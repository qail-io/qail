## [0.13.0] - 2025-12-30

### Breaking Changes ⚠️
- **Core:** Renamed `QailCmd` struct to `Qail` for a cleaner, "calmer" API.
  - *Note:* v0.12.0 still supported `QailCmd`. This release enforces the rename.
  - Rust: `QailCmd::get("table")` -> `Qail::get("table")`
  - Python: `from qail import QailCmd` -> `from qail import Qail`
- **Bindings:** Renamed C/FFI exported functions to remove `_cmd` suffix.
  - `qail_cmd_encode` -> `qail_encode`
  - `qail_cmd_free` -> `qail_free`

### Added
- **Core:** Added `impl Default` for `Qail` struct.
- **Go:** Updated Go bindings to support new `Qail` struct name and FFI symbols.
